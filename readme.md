# AutoPilot-X

AutoPilot-X is a **real-time autonomous decision engine** that monitors live system signals and makes **safe, explainable decisions** using deterministic logic — not black-box AI.

It continuously observes metrics (like CPU usage), evaluates risk over time, verifies confidence, and decides whether to act or stay idle. Every decision is explained in plain language and visible on a live dashboard.

The system supports real telemetry from a laptop, manual simulation for testing, drift detection, confidence gating, and controlled autonomous actions. It avoids false triggers and automatically stabilizes when conditions return to normal.

AutoPilot-X is designed for **cloud operations, infrastructure monitoring, and safety-critical systems** where transparency and control are required.

**Key idea:** it doesn’t generate responses — it makes decisions and explains them.
